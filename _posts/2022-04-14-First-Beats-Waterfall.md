If the old adage of "getting your crappy songs out of the way" is true, here are my best/worst submissions. I'll be using the "First Beats" prepender for these early creations and including my project files for anyone following along!

This was my first time tackling a project in GarageBand on iOS. Honestly, I was pretty impressed by the built-in effects, sample library, and overall fun that I'm getting out of this app. Definitely a nice alternative if you want to get away from the main computer (or overwhelming possibilities of Ableton Live) for a while.
